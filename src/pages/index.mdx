# BRENT GEORGE
## [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) - Applied Engineer
## Problem Solver / Life Long Learner

I enjoy tackling difficult problems wherever I can find them. I like the challenge, the growth, the roadblocks, the feeling when you're stumped, and the feeling when you break through.

That drive pulled me into the world of computers. My first semester of college, I took an Intro to Programming class and was hooked on the idea of leveraging computing to solve the most difficult problems there are.

While I started the Computer Engineering major at BYU, I also started working at internships. These jobs gave me opportunities to ingest problem descriptions, design a solution, and execute on that design.

I've setup telemetry data storage and reporting, helped migrate 3 million lines of code to the cloud, automated financial checks for payments processing, overhauled a UAT environment to improve availability, analyzed data patterns in FGPA aging experiments, and served as the president of a non-profit providing STEM learning for students.

I graduated from Brigham Young University in April 2022, and received a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan in April 2023. I then started at Deepgram as an Applied Engineer. As AI is rapidly becoming more accessible to the general population, I am thrilled to have a role centered on making Deepgram products work seamlessly and performant for varied use cases serving varied communities.

"When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before." - Jacob Riis
